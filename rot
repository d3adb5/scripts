# Run On Touchâ„¢ (not an actual trademark)
#
# A script that takes a command and runs it when a given file is "opened" with
# any program. The event is triggered by inotify, and the inotifywait program,
# from the inotify-tools package, is used to listen for it. The event is sent by
# the 'touch' command, which will usually be used as the trigger.
#
# The file is created by the first instance of this script that finds that it
# doesn't exist, and it is also responsible for removing it upon exiting. The
# file itself is /tmp/rot-trigger by default, but can be overriden by the
# ROT_WATCH_FILE environment variable.
#
# Example use:
#
#   Edit some file on Vim in one terminal, run the command:
#
#     :set makeprg=touch\ /tmp/rot-trigger
#
#   Open a new terminal and run something like:
#
#     rot stack test
#
#   From Vim, run ':make', then watch as 'stack test' is executed elsewhere.
#
# Dependencies: inotify-tools
